Are you? Why or why not?
I am not done with my methods, but am very close to completing them as I am
having trouble witn the roof method.

describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you
write? type? What were your thoughts?
That day I typed everything that you typed, I was very exited to start
drawing my own methods.

Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals
(as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not? 
Yes i did notice, mostly because its kinda obious.

Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
Yes I have,mostly to have a idea of what to do.

Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
private void drawHouseRoof(GraphicsContext gc1,int x,int y, int w,int h){
        gc1.setFill(Color.BLACK);
        //gc.fillPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, d);
        gc1.fillRoundRect(x,y,w,h,10,10);
        
       
    }
