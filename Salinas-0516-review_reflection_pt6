Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
taking a object from one type to a different type
up casting means to make it more making it more broad and downcating means
making it more presice.

Give a specific code example for up-casting
Cat c = new Cat();
    System.out.println(c);
    Mammal m = c; // upcasting
    System.out.println(m);
    
    /*
    This printed:
        Cat@a90653
      

Give a specific code example for down-casting
Cat c2 = (Cat) a;

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
What is the range of values for byte? Why?

char ch = 'J';

		String string1 = Character.toString(ch);

the range of values for byte is -128 to 127 because an 8-bit integer is
not a sign bit followed by a 7-bit unsigned integer.
