Are you Ready to begin coding your game?
Why or why not?
Yes, I am at this point ready to code my game since I already have the story
set it and just needed to be plugged in.


What will be your biggest challenge?
why?
I think my biggest challenge will be keeping track of how much hp the player'
has and what class they chose in the game since its 2 public numbers.
