Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game.
Why?
For my 2-D dungeon I will work on my older game from last year and improve
on it. It was based on having a girl being poisoned and try to find the
antidote on a maze.,while finding hp and speed boost potions along the way.
