What are 10 concepts you believe will be covered on the test. Why?

10 concepts I think will be covered on the test are HRM(because we spend a
week on it), Assembly(we dedicated a day on how its not easy), netbeams projects
(because its what we spend half the school year doing),arduino project(because
we also spend much on the time on it and it was easy),java(because thats the 
language we used in netbeams),python(another language that we used olot of),
arduino coding language(how we programmed our arduinos to did what they did),
inputs and outputs of arduino(again how we hooked up everything to the arduino
to make it work),different coding syntax(of java, python,arduino, and even HMU)
, and what we learned making the java game(classes, loops,thinking like a
computer, that stuff).
