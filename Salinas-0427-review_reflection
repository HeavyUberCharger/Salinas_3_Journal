Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
Students are encouraged to learn CS so they can develop skills to see patterns
in code and be able to then reuse that experience and incorporate it into 
their own projects and possibly even expand or simplify the skills. 

What should students learn from CS?
Students should learn CS to expand their thinking more broadly so they can
solve problems with more relative ease.
