Are you ready for that test on Friday?
I am so ready that I will do exacly what angie is doing(read hers so you know
what im talking about)

What specific questions do you have about the Slick game?
How can we pull certain attributes from player(e.g. hitbox) and use it
inside the Orb class without it being public? 
 
What will you have to do to get this working?
I will have to reflect back to my previous code in order to add or fix
any things left to do.

Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? if not be specific.
I think I am ready to take this test. Sometimes I can forget things and 
have difficulty putting it all together but I still feel confident enough
to pass.
