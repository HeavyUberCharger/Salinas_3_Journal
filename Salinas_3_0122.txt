What slick game did you create?
My slick game is unwaveringV2, a enhanced version of unwavering
with more items,levels, and bonus quest.

What challenges did you solve
Challenges I have solved while making my game are adding bonus items, creating
new maps,tranfering from one level to the other, and other small things to
enhance the structure of the code.  

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps
and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game
when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
Yes I did,mostly because I already had my level and spritesheets since
last year but did have to spend some days adding the extra 2 levels after
the break.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you
did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
Yes, I was able to sucessfully make everything I wanted thanks to my previous
pictures and spritesheets from last year.
