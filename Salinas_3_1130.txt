How successful were you with your game?
In what way? Be specific.
I was very sucessful with my game. I was able to get different methods and
gameplay mechanics such as hp, potions, and player choices working all in the
end contributing to the outcome. I was also able to repeat certain lines without having to retype them in to simplify and shorten my code.
