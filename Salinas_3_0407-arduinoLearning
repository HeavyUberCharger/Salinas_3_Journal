While working on the Arduino project, I have learned many different things
about the technology from how it works to the programming language it has.The
biggest thing I think I have taken from this arduino project so far is how to
interact with differnt sensors or electronics to have some kind of input in a
program. The first Thing and most useful sensor I have used is the tempeture
sensor, which takes the amount of power going trough the sensor and can
convert it to tempeture. Once the current has gona through the sensor, it
measures the return energy, then we use a math formula inside our code to
convert that amount to the tempeture.This is probably the easiest and best
demostration of how code and real life objects can interact to make something
unique.Another peice of technology that we are currently using is the LED
screen. This screen takes input from the arduino and displays it in the small
screen. It can represent anything from text to equations and in our project
the tempeture from the sensor. We were able to sucessfully hook up 2 different
objects to create a interactive project that we are both happy with.I have
learned how to program all these things thanks to the arduino project we are creating.
