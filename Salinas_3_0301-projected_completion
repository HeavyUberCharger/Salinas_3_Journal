Your revised Slick project is due Friday [Monday if you do homework]
Do you have another level?
YES, I have 2 fully operational and accesible levels ready in my game.

Will your revisions be complete? Why? Why not?
I think I will have MOST of the revisions complete by friday, some things
like enemis and control projectiles may take me the longest.
