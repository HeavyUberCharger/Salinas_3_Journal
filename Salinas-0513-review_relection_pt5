The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays.
Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals ---
other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing
the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment
(though they might have experienced it differently)
Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 -
that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization,
class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

I was the person who had some recollection of the previous journals to use
them in making my 2d array, I just couldnt remember when I did it.I remembered
because of how different they were and how useful they could be.

1:how to make 2d array
2:how to start a new class
3:how can you call a class from another class
4:how to make a object with many variables
5:how to call upon methods 
6:how is a while method structured
7:how can you draw a 2d array map
8:how do you make enemies follow you?
9:how can you draw different objects in a map without them colliding?
10:how can you use characters to dintinct enemies from the player
