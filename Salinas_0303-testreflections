What did you miss?
I think I missed most of the array making process questions. 
What could you have done to have been more successful?
I could have looked into arrays more and not purely used arraylist in my sick 
game.

If you were successful - what was it that you did that made you successful? 
I wasnt, so I cant really answer this.
