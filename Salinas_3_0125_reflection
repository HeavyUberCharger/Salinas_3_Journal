Briefly describe what you could have done to successfully complete your game?
Describe your problem solving / trouble shooting process.

I was able to sucessfully complete and upload my game to Mr.Davis before the
deadline.My problem solving/trouble shooting process was to reflect back at
I have done before and what I learned then apply it to the problem. If that
does not work then I will carefully review the problem and use other's code
to compare to mine and see what the issue is.
