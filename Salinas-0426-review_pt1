    Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

 public int cubednumber(int number){
 return number * number * number;

}

    Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.
int cubednumber(number)
{
return number * number * number*
}


    Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student
    Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

public Student{

boolean pencilBroken = false;
int pencilsLeft = 5;

void breakPencil(boolean new){
pencilBroken = new;
}

void getPencil(int new)
{
pencilsLeft = new;

}

}


If we continued with arduino I would create some type of game with the led screens and the
remotes you can hook up to anything.
