MY progress so far in my picture is that i have drawn the basic components to
the picture. I am drawing a house that has sun, trees, and maybe even cars or
people.currently I got the sun and most of the house done such as the walls
and roof and am just working on the windows and door.I am having some
trouble trying to make new shapes with unique sides but I know it will be 
solved soon.
