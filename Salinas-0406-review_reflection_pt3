Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate?
67 is the x cordinate and 43 is the y cordinate
 Why?How does this happen?
This happens because its like the cordinate system in math, x comes first
then y
Consider:


        for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                  if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                    } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.print("."); #e
                    } else {
                        System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                    }
                } else {
                    if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.println("."); #c
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
        
        
      

Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
	line a checks if i equals 0 and if true prints out 8888

Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
	line b prints out the map with a pint were i and j were made

Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its
different than #e
	line c prints out a . ,it is different from e because c prints out the
	y .s and line e printsb out the .s from the x. 

Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
	line d prints out the map with a point with i and j in the y axis
 
Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use
case and code example.
	you would set a boolean and use it to set the while to while that
	boolean is true to run.
	boolean alive = true;
	while(alive){

	}		

Explain the use of static.
	static is used when making a variable or function be accesible anywhere
	in the class.
Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code
example.
	you could use objects to add characteristics such as health or mana to 
	to a player or enemy.
	public class Player{
	int health = 100;
	int mana = 50;
	int speed = 3;
	boolean alive = true;
	
	}
